*Last updated July 2014.*

**In one sentence:** I'm a [product engineer for hire](http://calldownmule.com) starting a [year-long experiment in living abroad](/2014/07/03/when-visas-turn-into-pumpkins.html). First stop: helping run [Hacker Paradise](http://hackerparadise.org) in Costa Rica, Sept-Nov 2014.

I've been working as a [software consultant](http://calldownmule.com) since 2013, helping companies like Pebble, Dropbox, Tencent and Baydin with product development, growth and developer evangelism. I try to blog from time to time. I'm interested in behavioral economics (and online reputation systems more specifically), productivity and developer tools, as well as writing. Oh, and board games (especially lately), and rock climbing - that's fun too. The common thread is, I like solving problems with the tools available to me.

I finished a [CS degree from the University of Pennsylvania](http://www.cis.upenn.edu) in 2012 and have been living in the Bay Area ever since - except it seems I've run out of visa and am using this as an excuse to go travel for a year. I'll be back.

**Tech Community Organizer**
From 2009-2012 I focused on making Penn's CS department more start-up friendly; to that end, I started the <a href="http://pennapps.comndodaily.com/2013/01/21/the-worlds-largest-student-run-hackathon-isnt-at-stanford-or-mit-its-at-penn/">PennApps hackathon</a>, (the first major student-run hackathon in the US), and <a href="http://labs.pennapps.com">PennApps Labs</a>, a student-run, school-funded development group that focuses on improving student-run technology. I received the <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/student-life/award-recipients.php#student_choice">C N. Weygandt Award</a> for my contributions to the school.

In 2013, I helped start [The InternProject](http://theinternproject.com), a non-profit comprehensive resource for summer interns in the Bay Area to make sure they got the most out of their summer here, as well as the [Campus Data Summit](http://campusdata.org), helping grow the Student Data movement.

Since 2014, I am was one of the organizers of [HackCon](http://hackcon.io), a two-day conference for hackathon organizers and on the advisory board for [Major League Hacking](http://mlh.io).

**'Founder'**
In 2012, I co-founded [WiFast](http://www.wifast.com). From 2007-2009, a friend and I started and ran <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071112093619/http://www.fbdevdir.com/">fbdevdir.com</a>, a Facebook App consulting shop, working on over 30 projects for clients from Taleo to HP, as well as many smaller start-ups. I've played around with a few other ideas as well, but nothing worth discussing yet.

**Engineer**
I got into programming when I was 15, working on silly little games in Visual Basic.  From 2006-2009, I was a software engineer in the Israeli military. Since then, I've have had the opportunity to work on engineering problems for companies including Facebook, Dropbox, Pebble, and Baydin (they make the [Boomerang for Gmail](http://boomerangforgmail.com) plugin). I've also built an MVP and acted as 'first engineer' for [a start-up](http://binti.com), as well as engineering management consulting for first-time non-technical founders (help with hiring and managing technical people).

As of 2013, I am one of the authors and maintainers of [Houston](http://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/houston), a Django Admin-like zero-config admin for Meteor apps that has consistently been at or near the top 10 plugins for Meteor.

At Penn, I spent three semesters as an intro to CS TA and the next two as the technical lead for <a href="http://labs.pennapps.com">PennApps Labs</a>. <br><br>I like elegance and hate repetition, which explains my interest in programming languages, having worked in Scala, Haskell, OCaml, C, Java, Coffeescript, PHP, Python and Ruby (amongst others), as well as a bit of shell scripting.

**Writer**
I started blogging around October 2010, and have had several pieces, whether on <a href="http://alexeymk.com/tag/hackathons">hackathons</a>, the <a href="http://alexeymk.com/a-brief-guide-to-tech-internships">internship process</a>, or (strangely enough) <a href="http://alexeymk.com/dear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter">Richard Stallman</a> gain some popularity. Posterous tells me I've got about a bit more than a quarter million page views thus far. <br><br>I have also been featured on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/15/stop-looking-for-a-technical-co-founder/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/01/18/best-mashups-from-pennapps-2012-hackathon/">ProgrammableWeb</a> and <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/how-much-is-your-facebook-profile-worth-2007-11">AllFacebook</a> and spent a semester as a columnist for the <a href="http://thedp.com">Daily Pennsylvanian</a>.
