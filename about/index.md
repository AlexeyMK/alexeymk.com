*Last updated October 2013.*

**In one sentence:** I'm 2012 UPenn CS grad working on [helping CS students](http://threesat.com) pick what to do with their lives after they graduate.

In the past, I've worked as a [software consultant](http://calldownmule.com), and engineer, and I try to blog from time to time. I'm interested in behavioral economics (and online reputation systems more specifically), productivity and developer tools, as well as writing. If I only got to do one thing for the rest of my life, it would be product engineering.

**Tech Community Organizer**
From 2009-2012 I focused on making Penn's CS department more start-up friendly; to that end, I started the <a href="http://pennapps.comndodaily.com/2013/01/21/the-worlds-largest-student-run-hackathon-isnt-at-stanford-or-mit-its-at-penn/">PennApps hackathon</a>, (the first major student-run hackathon in the US), and <a href="http://labs.pennapps.com">PennApps Labs</a>, a student-run, school-funded development group that focuses on improving student-run technology. I received the <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/student-life/award-recipients.php#student_choice">C N. Weygandt Award</a> for my contributions to the school. In 2013, I helped start [The InternProject](http://theinternproject.com), a non-profit comprehensive resource for summer interns in the Bay Area to make sure they got the most out of their summer here.

**Founder**
In 2012, I was a co-founder at a startup that, any day now, will come out of stealth (promise). From 2007-2009, a friend and I started and ran <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071112093619/http://www.fbdevdir.com/">fbdevdir.com</a>, a Facebook App consulting shop, working on over 30 projects for clients from Taleo to HP, as well as many smaller start-ups.

**Engineer:** I got into programming when I was 15, working on silly little games in Visual Basic.  From 2006-2009, I was a software engineer in the Israeli military. I have had the opportunity to be an engineering intern at Facebook and 2bkco (now <a href="http://findery.com">Findery</a>), as well as contract for companies like Dropbox and [Baydin](http://baydin.com), creators of [Boomerang](http://boomerangforgmail.com).  I've recently fallen in love with the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) web framework, and am one of the authors of the reasonably-popular [Z-Mongo-Admin package](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/z-mongo-admin). At Penn, I spent three semesters as an intro to CS TA and the next two as the technical lead for <a href="http://labs.pennapps.com">PennApps Labs</a>. <br><br>I'm tremendously interested in programming languages, having worked in Scala, Haskell, OCaml, C, Java, Coffeescript, PHP, Python and Ruby (amongst others), as well as a bit of shell scripting.

**Writer:** I started blogging around October 2010, and have had several pieces, whether on <a href="http://alexeymk.com/tag/hackathons">hackathons</a>, the <a href="http://alexeymk.com/a-brief-guide-to-tech-internships">internship process</a>, or (strangely enough) <a href="http://alexeymk.com/dear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter">Richard Stallman</a> gain some popularity. Posterous tells me I've got about a bit more than a quarter million page views thus far. <br><br>I have also been featured on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/15/stop-looking-for-a-technical-co-founder/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/01/18/best-mashups-from-pennapps-2012-hackathon/">ProgrammableWeb</a> and <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/how-much-is-your-facebook-profile-worth-2007-11">AllFacebook</a> and spent a semester as a columnist for the <a href="http://thedp.com">Daily Pennsylvanian</a>.
