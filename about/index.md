*Last updated April 2016.*

**In one sentence:** [Digital nomad](http://hackerparadise.org), [product engineering consultant](http://calldownmule.com) and bios-in-the-third-person aficianado.

Between 2013 and 2016, I built out a [product engineering consulting company](http://calldownmule.com), helping San Francisco-based clients such as Dropbox, Pebble, Boomerang, and Binti grow and expand lines of business through a combination of product management and engineering.

In 2014, I left San Francisco to [travel while working remotely](/2014/07/03/when-visas-turn-into-pumpkins.html) and co-founded a [boutique work+travel company, Hacker Paradise](http://hackerparadise.org). Since the company's inception in 2015, we've run trips to 8 locations, been joined by more than [150 Alumni](http://hackerparadise.org/people) and booked more than $250k in revenue.

In 2012, I graduated with a [CS degree from the University of Pennsylvania](http://www.cis.upenn.edu), where I started the [PennApps](http://pennapps.com) Hackathon, a now-biannual event with over 1,500 student participants from unirsities across the US and beyond.

**Engineer**
I got into programming when I was 15, working on silly little games in Visual Basic.  From 2006-2009, I was a software engineer in the Israeli military. Since then, I've have had the opportunity to work on engineering problems for companies including Facebook, Dropbox, Pebble, and Baydin (they make the [Boomerang for Gmail](http://boomerangforgmail.com) plugin). I've also built several MVP and acted as 'first engineer' to help startups to raise subsequent funding. On occassion, I will act as a technical consultant for first-time non-technical founders who want help with estimating complexity and hiring/managing their initial hires.

In 2013, I was one of the authors and maintainers of [Houston](http://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/houston), a Django Admin-like zero-config admin for Meteor apps that has consistently been at or near the top 10 plugins for Meteor.

At Penn, I spent three semesters as an intro to CS TA and the next two as the technical lead for <a href="http://labs.pennapps.com">PennApps Labs</a>. <br><br>I like elegance and hate repetition, which explains my interest in programming languages, having worked in Scala, Haskell, OCaml, C, Java, Coffeescript, PHP, Python and Ruby (amongst others), as well as a bit of shell scripting.


**Tech Community Organizer**
From 2009-2012 I focused on making Penn's CS department more start-up friendly; to that end, I started the <a href="http://pennapps.comndodaily.com/2013/01/21/the-worlds-largest-student-run-hackathon-isnt-at-stanford-or-mit-its-at-penn/">PennApps hackathon</a>, (the first major student-run hackathon in the US), and <a href="http://pennlabs.org">Penn Labs</a>, a student-run, school-funded development group that focuses on improving student-run technology. I received the <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/student-life/award-recipients.php#student_choice">C N. Weygandt Award</a> for my contributions to the school.

In 2013, I helped start [The InternProject](http://theinternproject.com), a non-profit comprehensive resource for summer interns in the Bay Area to make sure they got the most out of their summer here, as well as the [Campus Data Summit](http://campusdata.org), helping grow the Student Data movement.

In 2014, I was one of the organizers of [HackCon](http://hackcon.io), a two-day conference for hackathon organizers, and remain an advisor to [Major League Hacking](http://mlh.io).

**Other Interests**
I'm interested in behavioral economics (and online reputation systems more specifically), productivity and developer tools, as well as writing. Oh, and tabletop games, cycling and Bouldering. The common thread is, I like solving problems with the tools available to me.
