title: About Me
---
<p><strong>In one sentence:</strong><br>I am a 25-year old recent CS graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, working on a startup in Palo Alto.</p>
<p><strong>Founder: <br></strong>I spent 2009-2012 at Penn, focusing on making the school's CS department more start-up friendly; to that end, I started the <a href="http://pennapps.com">PennApps hackathon</a>, (now the largest student-run hackathon in the US), and <a href="http://labs.pennapps.com">PennApps Labs</a>, a student-run, school-funded development group that focuses on improving student-run technology. I received the <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/student-life/award-recipients.php#student_choice">C N. Weygandt Award</a> for my contributions to the school. Before coming to Penn, a friend and I started and ran <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071112093619/http://www.fbdevdir.com/">fbdevdir.com</a>, a Facebook App consulting shop, working on over 30 projects for clients from Taleo to HP, as well as many smaller start-ups.</p>
<p><strong>Engineer:<br></strong>I got into programming when I was 15, working on silly little games in Visual Basic.  From 2006-2009, I was a software engineer in the Israeli military. I have had the opportunity to be an engineering intern at Facebook and 2bkco (now <a href="http://pinwheel.com">Pinwheel</a>); at Penn, I spent three semesters as an intro to CS TA and the next two as the technical lead for <a href="labs.pennapps.com">PennApps Labs</a>. <br><br>I'm tremendously interested in programming languages, having worked in Scala, Haskell, OCaml, C, Java, Coffeescript, PHP, Python and Ruby (amongst others), as well as a bit of shell scripting.  I hope to mess around with Scheme or Erlang when the opportunity next presents itself.</p>
<p><strong>Writer:<br></strong>I started blogging around October 2010, and have had several pieces, whether on <a href="http://alexeymk.com/tag/hackathons">hackathons</a>, the <a href="http://alexeymk.com/a-brief-guide-to-tech-internships">internship process</a>, or (strangely enough) <a href="http://alexeymk.com/dear-dr-stallman-an-open-letter">Richard Stallman</a> gain some popularity. Posterous tells me I've got about a bit more than a quarter million page views thus far. <br><br>I have also been featured on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/15/stop-looking-for-a-technical-co-founder/">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/01/18/best-mashups-from-pennapps-2012-hackathon/">ProgrammableWeb</a> and <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/how-much-is-your-facebook-profile-worth-2007-11">AllFacebook</a> and spent a semester as a columnist for the <a href="http://thedp.com">Daily Pennsylvanian</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Get in touch:</strong><br>Feel free to contact me - my gmail, not explicitly listed here, is pretty straightforward to guess. I'm also on <a href="http://twitter.com/alexeymk">the twitter</a> these days.</p>
