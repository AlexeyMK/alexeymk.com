**TL;DR** [Flystein](1) saved me over $1,000 on booking flights. So I like them.

I found myself planning a series of flights for [Hacker Paradise][2] this past month, flying from
<pre>Tel Aviv --> New York --> San Francisco --> Tokyo --> Tel Aviv</pre>
with a few days of flexibility for when to take each flight.

I spent about half an hour on Skyscanner and Google Flights, and couldn't find better than about $3,000. Which is a lot.

At roughly the same time, Vlad from [Flystein][1] reached out and offered to partner to help Hacker Paradise participants to book flights. So I gave it a try.

#### What's Flystein?
Glad you asked. Flystein, it turns out, is what a value travel agent looks like in the digital age. Instead of making money by taking some percentage of your booking fare from airlines, Flystein helps you find the cheapest possible fare online that meets your needs, and then charges a flat fee for doing so. You then book the flights yourselves, via links Flystein finds for you.

Taking money for providing value. Who knew.

#### How did it go?
I gave Flystein.com my itinerary and neurotic set of flight cost preferences.

A day later, they came back with flights totalling $1934.

A ~$1,150 difference between a "reasonably competent" online flight shopper spending half an hour and a bona fide expert.

#### How did things get so much cheaper?
**Phantom Round Trip** My Tel Aviv to New York flight includes a round trip flight back to Copenhagen in February. I'm probably not going to take it, but who knows. Also, who cares - it was $200 or so cheaper than the equivalent one-way flight. I would have never known to check.

** Phantom Leg** My San Francisco to Tokyo flight included a day-long layover in Tokyo, and then continued on to Hong Kong. I, however, never made it on the connection. One day, Hong Kong, one day.

There's a [whole series of flight hacks](TODO: link) like the above you can find to considerably lower your costs, if you know what to look for and are willing to spend the time. Or you can use Flystein.

#### How was booking?
Mostly fine. One of my flight legs was expired by the time I looked (you have to be book pretty quickly afterwards) and I ended up calling British Airways, only to be told that I needed to pay them thousands of dollars.

So I pinged Vlad on Skype. After cursing about British Airways for a bit, he found a flight that worked perfectly a few minutes later. It cost me $20 more.

#### Future features
**Book my flight** The whole booking episode could have been avoided if I had the ability to go full "travel agent" and just given Flystein permission to book on my behalf. It turns out there are legal reasons why doing so is not trivial, but they're on it.

**Points & Alliances** [Sam](http://samhogg.com) recently explained to me that I needed to pick an airline alliance and try to level-up my frequent flier miles with them. I haven't been doing so, because I'm silly. I'm told Flystein can help by favoring airlines of a certain alliance or even finding ways to use your loyalty points as part of the flight cost.

#### Was it worth it?
Flystein saved me over $1,000 dollars (after trying). The total (retail) cost of their flights was less than $100 dollars. So, yes.  90%+ of the savings for 0% of the time to learn how phantom  leg-fu. Value.

**...but what if they don't find anything?** Fair question. It's possible you've _already_ found the cheapest rate you're going to get. Luckily, Flystein has (1) a money-back guarantee and (2) a beat-my-price option. In either case, you only get charged if Flystein actually saves you as much as they charge.

[Flystein][1]. Use it when booking flights of non-trivial complexity. It's a thing.

#### PS. Are you a shill?
Absolutely. Vlad offered to organize my flight for free in exchange for writing up the experience. Worth it.
