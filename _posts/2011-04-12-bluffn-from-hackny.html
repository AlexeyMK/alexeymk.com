<p>I was at <a href="http://www.hackny.org">HackNY</a>&nbsp;over the weekend; our resulting demo is below (starting at the 9 minute mark).</p>

<p>Given a chance, I'm hoping to put together a longer article about solid Hackathon demos and building the product vs building the demo.</p>
<p>We didn't win anything, but (until my __real__ bug) I was pretty happy with the quality and interactivity that we were able to achieve.</p>
