Why Opendoor is interesting.

Opendoor buys & sells homes. Successful. Early.

It's not shiny. It's not AR or drones or big data (well, a little). It's not massive consumer like FB or #snap. But it's exciting as fuck. 

It's not obvious but once you get it you get why we have 5 former YC founders doing IC eng work and a bunch of super senior folks.

First you gotta understand.

Why are you an engineer? What is your job? 
You create value. 

What is Opendoor value? We make people's lives less stressful for as little as possible.

So you can either (1) reduce stress or (2) make it cheaper.

I'll focus on (2).  Here's what needs to happen if you sell a home. You need to A, B, C. It sucks.

With us you don't, but we have to charge you like 9% on average. Why? Cause we gotta pay for A, B, C.

What if we fixed A? (sarah example). It turns out B, C, and you would save like $Z per home. Which we give back to the customer. Happy customer.

But to do that we have to domain-model A, B, C effectively so we can try changes like A and understand what is going on. The modeling is hard. Lots of humans.

So here's why it's interesting. You've gotta support the existing process while trying A and understanding the impact. Creativity and domain modeling. Also super small team so you kinda need to have your shit together.

high bar, great engineers, all the coworkers are super pragmatic because we realize that we're upgrading each part as we go and nothing is permanent. lane structure is one example.

Super high leverage. Less expenses --> cheaper fees --> more business. Virtuous cycle, engineering is key to keeping the factory running ever better.

so it's good, come work here.
