<p>I still remember the rush from the first project I ever worked on that went viral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cobol on Rails, was a re-design of the Penn's online Course Review system. The old tool was written as some senior's Senior Design project in 2003 and kept on life support by the University IT. &nbsp;It was (by the time we got to it) terrible. &nbsp;It looked like this &lt;SCREENSHOT&gt;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cobol on Rails was built in PHP and mySQL. &nbsp;We wanted to pick up web development, and were part of the first PennApps competition in late 2009. &nbsp;We'd gotten the reviews data dump from the Course Review folks, a student-run group who was trying to find somebody to take over web responsibilities (their webmaster had graduated).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We worked weekend after weekend, in 12-hour sprints trying to figure out what the hell a border-radius was and how you made PHP code feel less like spaghetti. &nbsp;I still remember var_dump as a fond friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked. Exhausted but jubilant the Saturday of the deadline I emailed the Course Review folks. &nbsp;"We're done, check it out!" &nbsp;A few of the other teammates emailed a link to their friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days later, we were on Under the Button. &nbsp;Apparently, those initial emails had gone viral and we were getting a couple of thousand unique visitors a day - a good percentage of the school. &nbsp;I spent the day staring at my email between classes, responding to all the feedback we were getting. My heart was racing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Course Review folks emailed us too. "I can't believe you guys did this," they wrote. &nbsp;"You promised not to start a competitor! &nbsp;The Dean is not happy."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had to password-protect the thing (the password was 'password', and you could tell it you viewed the source).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students went back to using the crappy old site, and the Course Review folks were mad enough at us to not take any of our advice about UX improvements seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that experience, I learned:</p>
<p>--------------------------------</p>
<p>- Left to its own doing, student-run tech will at best be abandoned and at worst rust, left behind by technology but too useful to be let end by its users.</p>
<p>- That is not the only possible outcome.</p>
<p>- Life is better with the powers at be co-opted on your side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those ideas stuck around the back of my mind for a while. I was (by sheer "you seem interesting, want to get coffee?") friends with Cynthia, one of the Student Government folks. &nbsp;In the summer of 2000, following Princeton's lead, they decided to start their own Book Exchange (PennBookBazaar.com). &nbsp;The Bookstore took huge fees and the old student-run book exchange, BetterThanTheBookstore.com, had closed and the founders went on to go start Invite Media and sell it to Google for $100M. &nbsp;So it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Cynthia was like "You're a computer person, can you make this thing work for us? Here is Princeton's code!" &nbsp;And, I didn't. I had no desire whatsoever to work for Student Government people, and I was a little busy being a Facebook intern and working on starting a Hackathon&lt;link&gt;. &nbsp;So they went ahead and did it on their own. It was simple but not ugly and pretty successful (marketing isn't so hard if you can email the entire school on a whim).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Hackathon, the first-place team built something called SEASPrint, which was an Android App that let you login with your Engineering Credentials and print from your phone. &nbsp;Google Cloud Print came out a few months later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEASPrint was awesome, and it already worked. I used it all throughout college thereafter. No doubt, with time it would probably start to fall over unless somebody made sure it was up-to-date, and would be forgotten unless discoverable. &nbsp;But the team had no particular interest in supporting it long term. That sucked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, it clicked. &nbsp;Student-run tech does not have to suck. It does not have to become out-dated or unsupported or quarrel with the administration. It can be rewarding, and it is possible to entice talented engineers to spend their time on it, since having friends use something you made feels amazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Penn, this turned into PennApps Labs, a student-run development shop that creates, adopts and maintains student technology. &nbsp;Funded by (and therefore co-opting) the Provost and the Student Government, it pays TA-competitive wages to about 5 students a semester, who work on either creating new applications (such as a Study Space Search) or updating existing ones, such as Penn Course Review, which we adopted and launched in October 2012. &nbsp;PennApps Labs is also created to adopt and promote successful student-run projects, so future generations can benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The organization is also aimed to be open. Created applications are aimed to be open-source (with as few exceptions as possible) and patches from the community, as well as intended for adoption at other schools. Open APIs, including the Registrar and Course Reviews, are established whenever possible, to make the lives of student hackers less scraping and more creating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think it's fair to say the organization has met all of my original goals yet. &nbsp;But it's made some pretty solid progress - Penn's Course Review tool looks a lot closer to Cobol on Rails than it used to - and it's in good hands to continue to innovate. &nbsp;In my mind, it's a model worth exploring, an idea worth forking.</p>
