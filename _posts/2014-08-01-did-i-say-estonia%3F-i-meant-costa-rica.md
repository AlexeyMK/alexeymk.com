I'm putting [Estonia](/2014/07/03/when-visas-turn-into-pumpkins.html) on hold - still excited to go there, and hoping to do so in April or May, once it warms up again.

In the meanwhile, I'm heading to Costa Rica to help facilitate [Hacker Paradise](http://hackerparadise.org) a 12-week digital retreat. The location has all the benefits of nomadism (cheap, beautiful location with delicious food and friendly people) while bringing together a small community of hackers working on individual learning, contracting or their own companies.

Here's how it happened: [Casey Rosengren](https://twitter.com/CaseyRosengren), a Penn classmate and fellow [Penn Hackathon organizer](http://www.hackthechange.org/), was doing the whole travel-and-freelance thing and did some work for a boutique hotel that was down to give Casey the entire place for a couple of months, leading to the creation of Hacker Paradise. I saw one of Casey's posts about the place, and offered to come help.

In short: I'll be hacking by the pool in Costa Rica until November if you need me.


PS. Care to join, either for the whole 12 weeks or for a shorter trip? We're [keeping a couple of spots open](http://hackerparadise.org).
