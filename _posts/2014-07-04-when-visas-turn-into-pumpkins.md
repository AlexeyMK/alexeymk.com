**TL;DR**: My US work visa runs out in a month, so I'm leaving for about a year to go travel. I start on August 2014.

...actually, that's it.

### FAQ
- **Wait, you're not American?** I'm an Israeli citizen born in Ukraine. I came to the US for my undergraduate degree. I kind of sound American because I went to the [American International School](http://wbais.org) for elementary through high school in Israel.

- **So what's the story with the visas?**
I was able to stay in the US on my F-1 (student) visa for two a half years after graduation through OPT and STEM. This year, I applied for an H1-B visa with a sponsor - there were [172k people for 85k slots](http://www.happyschools.com/172500-h1b-visa-2015-petitions-lottery-complete/).  There was a lottery, and I didn't make it. [Could have been worse](http://sites.middlebury.edu/individualandthesociety/files/2010/09/jackson_lottery.pdf).

- **Well, that sucks. Anything I can do to help?** It's fine, really. Thanks for your concern! I've been meaning to travel for a while, so the timing works out. If you'd like to help,
  * Recommend particular cities that you think would be great places to live for 2 months
  * If you know any good companies that do remote work, I might be interested
  * ...actually, if you have the space and aren't planning to move for a year, I wouldn't mind storing a bit of stuff in your basement

- **What's the plan?**
Largely TBD, but the tentative plan is to live in six different locations for about two months each.

The first stop is **Tallinn, the capital of Estonia**.  Why? [Wired swears by it](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/european-startups), and my further research confirms Tallinn should be an interesting place. I don't know if I want to work on my own ideas or contract remotely yet - time will tell. Plans are still up in the air for the next destination, but I _am_ hoping to get a couple of months of skiing in over January & February.

- **That sounds fun! Can I come visit?**
Absolutely. My plan is, rent prices permitting, to have a guest bedroom in every place I'll be living in.

- **...so, are you coming back?**
I certainly plan to. I love it here.

- **Our immigration policies are ridiculous!**
That's not a question. Also, politics is hard! If you want to help, consider supporting [fwd.us](http://fwd.us) or one of many other immigration reform groups.

- **Let's hang out before you leave!** Totes. [Email me](mailto:alexey+beforeyouleave@alexeymk.com) and let's try to find a time and a place.
