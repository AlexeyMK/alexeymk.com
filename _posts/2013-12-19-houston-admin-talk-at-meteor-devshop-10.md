I gave a talk at the latest Meteor Devshop a couple of weeks ago about [Houston](http://github.com/gterrono/houston), 
the Django-Admin like tool that Greg, Geoff and I are working on for Meteor.

With over [200 stars on Github](http://github.com/gterrono/houston), I think we might _almost_ be real Open Source Contributors now. It's fun!

If you're into web development and Javascript and real-timey things, check out [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

If you already know about Meteor, you should try [Houston](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/houston).

If you already use Houston (whoa, thanks!) check out the [feature wishlist](https://github.com/gterrono/houston/#wishlist) and send us some pull requests!

PS. I thoroughly enjoyed TA-ing in college and I miss it, so public speaking on technical subjects is a ton of fun (though nerve-wrecking) for me.  If you've got tips for things I should work on after seeing the talk, please email me!
