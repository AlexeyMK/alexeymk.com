I helped organize [HackCon](http://hackcon.io), a conference for student hackathon organizers, this past weekend in NY.

I gave a talk about [Hackonomics](https://medium.com/hackers-and-hacking/ad619910b134), trying to quantify the financial benefit for hackathon sponsors and figuring out what the future looks like. I then [annotated the slides](https://medium.com/hackers-and-hacking/ad619910b134) - on Medium, for a change.

The writing style here is a lot more like the talk I gave - more stream-of-consciosness than well-organized. Different, but not necessarily worse. Hopefully.
