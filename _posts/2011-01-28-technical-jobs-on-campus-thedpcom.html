<p>Here's something I've been meaning to do for a while: post a filtered list of worthwhile coding job openings on campus and around. Openings are going to be limited to ones that I think are awesome. As such, the list is going to be arbitrary but useful. Subscribe to the 'jobs' tag if you're interested.</p>

<div><strong>Pros: </strong>You're work on a website you and your friends use on a daily basis (maybe? hopefully?). &nbsp;It feels good. &nbsp;You learn a ton about doing web development <em>reasonably </em>right in a production environment.</div>
<div><strong>Cons: </strong>The DP can take over your life. Also, the pay is terrible (either nothing or a couple of hundred bucks a month). &nbsp;Also, there's a good chance you'll have random business people who want you to do things like help create content for advertising.</div>
<div><strong>Counter-Cons: </strong>There's nothing wrong with things taking over your life, so long as they're good things. Also, the DP is a large and tight-knit community that puts together an award-winning newspaper. So there's that.</div>
<div><strong>Good for: </strong>Freshmen/sophomores and anybody looking to learn/get into web development but preferring a formal structure.</div>
<div><strong>How I know: </strong><a href="http://www.dangetelman.com/">Dan Getelman</a>&nbsp;ran the DP website starting spring of his freshman year. He turned out <a href="http://www.coursekit.com">all right.</a></div>
