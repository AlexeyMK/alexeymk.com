[CEO name],

I want to give you a quick heads-up about the way you handled my rejection. As the hiring manager for my last start-up, I had to reject a few dozen hires myself and have thought about this interaction.  The advise is unsolicited and take it as you will, but I was sufficiently offended that I figured I should share.

**First**, I emailed you directly, after we met in person. I got a response, without context, from somebody else entirely; it felt like you (effectively) completely ignored me.

**Second**, [recruiter]'s email or your statement is inaccurate.  You directly said that you were hiring engineers on Tuesday and I get an email on Thursday saying you're not.  It felt like one of those must be a lie, and it reflects poorly on your company.

**Third**: a rejection is a bit like an needle injection; yeah, it's not going to be pleasant, but at least you can make an effort to minimize the discomfort.  You rejected me because you don't want to deal with contractors, or my background isn't impressive enough, or not a fit; that's cool. I'm not suggesting you give me direct feedback on my resume (I didn't send one in) because I know what a mess it can be to argue with potential candidates. But: you have such a great cop out.

From a friend at Google, their philosophy on recruiting is, roughly, "we should be really nice to the engineers we interview, because most engineers out there will remember Google as that company they applied to and got rejected from, and these are the people recommending technology to their parents and advising friends on where to apply."

I think you're working on a great mission and you guys are going to need all the talent, engineering or otherwise, you can get. I know rejection letters/the approach to a rejection feels like a small thing, but they're worth getting right.
