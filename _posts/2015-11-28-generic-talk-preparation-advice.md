Hey! Good to see you too. I heard you were preparing a talk, that’s super exciting. What’s it on? Cool. I’d love to help - do you want to do a run-through with me? Great, let’s do it.

...

Cool, cool. Good solid initial approach, I think the topic is solid and you’re a good person to give this talk. I’ve got a bunch of feedback, things to think about for the next draft. Ready?  Here goes:

### The Youtube Test
Is there a well-known talk, or a famous speaker, who has a more polished, more credible version of this talk available online?  Perhaps your version is not a good use of your audience’s time.

Don’t despair, though! Let’s find a version of your talk that passes the Youtube Test.

**The Case Study** - Let’s not talk about the physics of space travel directly. Let’s focus on how you learned about theoretical physics, what surprised you, and which parts you were eventually able to use it for that trip to Alpha Centauri. The Case Study is easier to follow, has enough content included to be informative, and leads an interested audience member to the canonical Youtube talk about the Cosmological Physics, which you would mention at the end of your talk.

**The Niche** - Gardening as a topic has been covered competently and thoroughly, but nobody has given a growing introduction that focuses on ripening basil indoors. Which temperature is ideal; how do you organize lighting and how often do you plant; when do you harvest? A niche topic is easier to follow along with because of focus on the specific over the abstract, and some lessons from the niche generalize.

### Story Time
Once upon a time, there was a speaker who thought if he told people facts, they would remember them directly and thank the speaker for changing their life/perspective. But that didn’t happen and the speaker was disheartened.

Next, the speaker tried weaving his facts into a coherent narrative. In this narrative, the facts flowed out as conclusions from the story. That worked better, so the speaker was happy. Also, the audience didn’t feel lectured-to. Everybody lived happily ever after.

### What are slides for?
Back in college, at the beginning of Senior Year, this lady from the Critical Writing Department sat us down and power-pointed at us for fifty minutes about giving effective presentations. Probably. I zoned out a few minutes in and went back to my laptop, occasionally glancing up to see if her latest slide-essay had anything useful on it. It did not.

TODO(AMK): make this next paragraph into a slide

The corporate world and academia have given birth, somehow, to a devil-offspring known as slide-outline culture. It’s that thing you do when you write your talk by writing the slides, and the slides are effectively the outline, and then the “talking” part is you mostly reading the slides out loud and elaborating a little bit if you couldn’t get the font-size small enough to include the elaboration onto the slide.

At this point you have made yourself obsolete. Send out the slide-deck and save everybody the time. A standalone slide deck is not the worst medium in which to communicate ideas, by the way, like a photo essay, but with more charts.

TODO(AMK): Mary Meeker’s state of the internet can be useful here.

#### Start with zero slides.
If you’ve decided to give a talk after all, you should do that instead. As an experiment, especially as you are starting out, don’t use any slides. Write (and present) the first draft of your talk entirely verbally.

Once that version of the talk works, think about where visual aids might be useful - a chart to illustrate a trend, a photo to talk about a place or evoke an emotion, a feline meme to illustrate you share the audience’s pedestrian taste for lowbrow entertainment. Anytime you wish you could point to something - there.

It’s perfectly OK to have a talk with only one slide. Include the title for people who think they might be in the wrong room, and your twitter handle for your soon-to-be legion of followers.

### Table of Boring
Outlines are super useful. I outlined this piece before I wrote it to make sure I had a handle on the points I wanted to hit, and in which order. But an outline is a tool for the speaker, not the audience.

Often, talks start with a table of contents. Yours shouldn’t. If you think it’ll help the audience follow along, it won’t - by the time they could use it, they won’t be able to refer back to it.

_Next, I’m going to discuss another talk pattern that I think is dumb, and tell you why it’s dumb._ I’ve been advised, “tell them what you’re going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you told them.” Why not just use that time to tell them more useful things?  _What I just did there was to provide a question which showed why the talk pattern is silly, since it is not a good use of time._

Also, you’re messing up your sense of narrative suspense. I’m going to tell you how Harry beat Voldemort. He lost, he died, but then mother’s love brought him back and he won. So that was how Harry defeated Voldemort, which I told you about just now.

### <span\>Attention</span\>
Kids these days, they’re on their phones all the time and they don’t pay attention to anything unless there’s a car chase or giant robots or a giant robot car chase.

That’s what you’re up against. It’s a tall order, but it’s still your job. Narrative suspense is one thing that can make you compelling; there are others. Figure out what they are for your talk or the Michael Bays win.

### Thanks for coming in!
I’m not a particularly great speaker myself and almost everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned by watching or hearing better speakers. I’d argue this piece passes the Medium Test by virtue of amalgamation - I’ve given enough advice to friends, colleagues, and Hacker Paradise participants at this point that it’s worthwhile getting it all down in a single page somewhere.

I offer you some of my favorite presentation examples and further reading from people who know what they are talking about.
