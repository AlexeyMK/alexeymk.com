Things I miss about living in the Future

> The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed - William Gibson

Whether it's same-day online delivery, a car service, or on-demand laundry, start-ups run their pilots in the Bay Area. There's even a site for finding the "Uber for X" for whatever you need [TODO: find uber for x site]. 

I've been living outside the future bubble for about five months now, visiting Germany, Italy, Croatia, Israel, Costa Rica, Buenos Aires, and Panama.  It's different.

### I miss
- Not worrying about transporation.
Cabs, especially with a language barrier, are a pain. It's not obvious that you'll be able to explain where you need to get (or that the driver know how to get there), you're a little worried for your personal safety, and you have no easy way of telling if the drive is going to gauge you.

Uber is far from perfect (and has had a rough month), but I really miss being able to know when my ride will arrive and how much I should pay. It's overhead. Overhead sucks.

- Not having a wallet.
I switched to a combination of smartphone + credit card in phone case + Venmo a couple of years ago, in an effort to minimize things I had to carry around. It works wonderfully on the US coasts (except for random SF places that want cash, but that's what friends with Venmo are for).

Abroad, I have to worry about having cash (but not too much cash, in case I get robbed) and consistently making to avoid tourist traps when changing money. In Argentina, you _have_ to convert currency on the grey market if you don't want to pay a 60% official premium.

- Centrality.
The way to fly from Israel to Costa Rica, it turns out, is almost entirely through a hub like Houston, New York or Miami.  In San Francisco, there's a pleasantly large number of places I can fly to direct.  Did you know that having a layover in the US without a Visa means you need to pay $30 and re-check your baggage? Yup.

- Climbing and Cycling
It's tough to appreciate just how good Bay Area bouldering gyms are until you try one abroad. Smaller, substantially less newbie-friendly, full of pros and bros.  

On the cycling side, I miss the surprising quality of my Bicycle. Bikes abroad are cheap, but you get what you pay for - and drivers outside of the future are a lot less cautious about your personal safety.

### Things I thought I'd miss, but it turned out OK.
- mobile data 
I was planning on buying a SIM card for data in every country, but T-Mobile's $50 simple choice plan proved to solve most of my problems. It's a little pricey given that I barely use it, but worth it when you consider the cost of solving the mobile data problem abroad.

Cafes generally speaking have Wi-Fi as often as they do in the US, and when things break, their router admin password is as easy to guess and the interface is still in English.

- finding places to live
The future has a tremendously competitive and pricey housing market. The present does not. Whether by finding monthly rentals on Airbnb or googling 'Apartments <City>', I was able to find reasonbly priced places without too much hassle.

- friends & comrades
I missed seeing future-friends, but many - much more than I expected - ended up popping by for a couple of weeks of vacation. That was nice. Through [Hacker Paradise](http://hackerparadise.org) I got to meet new friends and was surrounded by people I could bug for help when stuck on a coding problem (and vice versa). I met weekly via Hangouts with clients. All in all, this was alright.

- Splitting the bill.
As it turns out, most of the friends I was traveling with had Venmo. The Venmo mobile app works abroad, so you can still have one person pay the bill and the others Venmo for their amounts.
