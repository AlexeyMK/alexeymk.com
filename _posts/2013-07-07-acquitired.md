Start-ups are rocketships.  We work at blazing speeds and we try to hire rockstars and we seek escape velocity, or die trying. I used to think that dying basically meant running out of money before 'getting there,' but based on my own experience and that of more than enough friends, it's actually more complicated than that.

As a startup, you have two limited resources: money and goodwill.  You can raise money from investors or you can pump your own money in (either directly or by not taking a salary).  If you run out of money you're kind of screwed, especailly if you have underlying costs like infrastructure or employees. You can obtain more money either directly through the business, or by asking others (typically investors) for more money. Usually doing so is a lot easier if you've made some sort of progress since the last time you asked them for money, but not necessarily.  Some people are inherently better at raising money than others, and that'll correlate reasonably with the ability to succeed as a company.

Your initial reserve of goodwill is based on you and your team: how well do you guys know each other already, and how much respect/trust/love is already there between you.  You gain goodwill, typically, anytime something good happens (a new big customer, user growth, funding) but you can also try to grow it directly by doing things like company off-sites or making sure an employee has the day off without asking when his daughter is sick. You maintain goodwill by doing things like 1-on-1s and giving a clear sense of both purpose and measurement to employees.

You spend goodwill anytime you ask the team, directly or implicitly, to work at an unsustainable pace. You lose it when you do stupid shit, or when something bad happens, or when you can't agree on what to do next.  Compared to money, it's a lot harder to predict the rate at which you will lose goodwill and so you can't quite budget for goodwill as easily.

You've seen start-ups run out of goodwill before.  That's what most acquihires are, from what little I've seen: folks get tired and they want to have some money and a slighltly more secure job and most importantly to stop feeling like losers. Most acquihires I've seen are really acquitires, an acquisition due to a company running out of goodwill rather than money.

So what?
- "Co-founding a company is like a marriage without the sex." You can easily start with a substantially higher amount of goodwill reserves if you work with people you've worked with before and have a strong connection with. It's scary to start a company with your friends because you're afraid the friendship may not survive the company failing. Tough - start-ups are about taking risks and maximizing your chances of success.

Drew and Arash from Dropbox didn't know each other that well (supposedly) when they started, and they turned out alright. That either proeves my thesis wrong, or it shows that when things work out phenomenally well the initial low reserve of goodwill didn't matter.

- Same thing with hiring - hire people you already know and have relationships with. Max Levchin explained this well (link) when he spoke about diversity being a bad idea early on.  Why spend goodwill arguing about choices of tech stack and TDD?  That shit is expensive.

- Some people are way fucking better at goodwill than others. I've met several people who were politely described to me as "controvercial" that were running start-ups that had quite a bit of buzz and a solid team, and were starting to gain traction. I've seen more than one of these controvercial start-ups die a death that was very clearly goodwill-based.  There are clearly more than a couple well-known huge successful start-ups out there that are known to have been started by jerks, but, again - things must have worked out really well for them early, creating sufficient goodwill reserves to offset their dickishness.

On the flipside, I've met certain founders that just sort of radiate genuine goodheartedness, the kinds of people I keep trying to help, just because. I would attribute at least part of their start-up's cause for success to the beacons of goodwill at their helm.
