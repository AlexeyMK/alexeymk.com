For a start-up, running out of money is not as easy as it used to be.

- *Inventory costs* (hosting, computers) have gone down
- *Time-to-MVP* has gone down significantly, and requires a smaller team.
- Iterating is easier and faster, both in terms of effort and in terms of feedback methodology
- Fund-raising used to be selective at the seed level (compared to the relative spray-and-pray of today).
- Quality advice is available, whether by reading Hacker News directly, or joining one of the incubators/accelerators/etcetera.
- Distribution is still difficult, but with various app stores and Facebook and Twitter as viral channels, getting to a million users takes an order of effort magnitude less than before.

Starting a company is still *hard*. It's just the barriers keep getting lower.  And the side-effect is, fewer start-ups are failing because they run out of money.

#### Death by morale bankrupcy
Instead, more of them run out of steam (or goodwill, or karma, or morale), defined as

> the amount of collective excitement that the team has to wake up in the morning and get to work. The opposite (or absense) of steam is dread.

My evidence is anecdotal.  More than a few of my friends have started companies, friends whose success I would expect and in whom I would invest, have run out of steam. I'm no longer at the company I helped start a year and a half ago.

#### Steam as a (limited) resource

How's your company doing? Founders point to available cash-in-bank or talk about their burn rate and months of runway. But they don't talk about the fact that a key engineer just quit and people haven't been talking much around the office for the past couple of weeks. Other than going on an occasional company trips, I haven't seen much attempts made at managing steam.  This is unfortunate, since steam is very much a limited resource that follows a lot of the same rules as money.

Your initial reserve of steam is based on you and your team: how well do you guys know each other already, and how much respect/trust/love is already there between you.  You can earn steam, typically, anytime something good happens (a new big customer, user growth, funding) but you can also try to grow it directly by doing things like company off-sites or making sure an employee has the day off without asking when his daughter is sick. You maintain steam by doing things like 1-on-1s and giving a clear sense of both purpose and feedback to employees.

You spend steam anytime you ask the team, directly or implicitly, to work at an unsustainable pace. You lose it when you (personally) do stupid shit, or when something bad happens to the company, or when you can't agree on what to do next.  Compared to money, it's harder to predict the 'burn rate' for steam.

#### What happens when you run out of steam
Anything from everybody going their own way and unfriending the others on Facebook to a modest acquisition.  From my anecdotal evidence, a lot of acquisitions stem from a bankrupcy of steam - "I'm just so tired of this shit, I just want a comfortable job again make sure the folks I hired have a soft landing."  I've been calling these acquitires, when a company gets acquihired because everybody's tired of working at a company that has been morally running on empty.

#### So what?
If you're starting a company, be cognizant of steam as a limited resource.

The same way you optimize for "smart and gets things done" (among other things) from your co-founders and early hires, optimize for steam - somebody you really get along with, somebody that you sense can bring people up when they are down, somebody resilient.

Add steam as an ingredient in deciding what to work on. Extend decisions about features from "how much time and money will this take, how likely is it to succeed, and how big of an impact would it have if successful" to "...and how happy would it make us if we offered it."

You're supposed to keep at least a few months' worth of burn in the bank - keep team morale at a reasonable level at all times.  Raising money is *way* harder if you need it urgently; raising morale is *way* harder once morale is low.

As an employee, make an effort to spend quality time with *basically, founders can BS, employees can't, so make sure you understand where steam si @"

AMK FROM HERE
As a startup, you have two limited resources: money and steam.  You can raise money from investors or you can pump your own money in (either directly or by not taking a salary).  If you run out of money you're kind of screwed, especailly if you have underlying costs like infrastructure or employees. You can obtain more money either directly through the business, or by asking others (typically investors) for more money. Usually doing so is a lot easier if you've made some sort of progress since the last time you asked them for money, but not necessarily.  Some people are inherently better at raising money than others, and that'll correlate reasonably with the ability to succeed as a company.

Your initial reserve of steam is based on you and your team: how well do you guys know each other already, and how much respect/trust/love is already there between you.  You gain goodwill, typically, anytime something good happens (a new big customer, user growth, funding) but you can also try to grow it directly by doing things like company off-sites or making sure an employee has the day off without asking when his daughter is sick. You maintain goodwill by doing things like 1-on-1s and giving a clear sense of both purpose and measurement to employees.

You spend steam anytime you ask the team, directly or implicitly, to work at an unsustainable pace. You lose it when you do stupid shit, or when something bad happens, or when you can't agree on what to do next.  Compared to money, it's a lot harder to predict the rate at which you will lose goodwill and so you can't quite budget for goodwill as easily.

You've seen start-ups run out of steam before.  That's what most acquihires are, from what little I've seen: folks get tired and they want to have some money and a slighltly more secure job and most importantly to stop feeling like losers. Most acquihires I've seen are really acquitires, an acquisition due to a company running out of goodwill rather than money.

So what?
- "Co-founding a company is like a marriage without the sex." You can easily start with a substantially higher amount of steam reserves if you work with people you've worked with before and have a strong connection with. It's scary to start a company with your friends because you're afraid the friendship may not survive the company failing. Tough - start-ups are about taking risks and maximizing your chances of success.

Drew and Arash from Dropbox didn't know each other that well (supposedly) when they started, and they turned out alright. That either proeves my thesis wrong, or it shows that when things work out phenomenally well the initial low reserve of steam didn't matter.

- Same thing with hiring - hire people you already know and have relationships with. Max Levchin explained this well (link) when he spoke about diversity being a bad idea early on.  Why spend steam arguing about choices of tech stack and TDD?  That shit is expensive.

- Some people are way fucking better at steam than others. I've met several people who were politely described to me as "controvercial" that were running start-ups that had quite a bit of buzz and a solid team, and were starting to gain traction. I've seen more than one of these controvercial start-ups die a death that was very clearly goodwill-based.  There are clearly more than a couple well-known huge successful start-ups out there that are known to have been started by jerks, but, again - things must have worked out really well for them early, creating sufficient goodwill reserves to offset their dickishness.

On the flipside, I've met certain founders that just sort of radiate genuine goodheartedness, the kinds of people I keep trying to help, just because. I would attribute at least part of their start-up's cause for success to the beacons of steam at their helm.

- Watch out!  When a company is trying to hire you and talking about how much money they have in the bank and how awesome they are, don't let that be enough. Spend enough time, either directly or by asking around, and figure out whethere there is enough steam to go around and whether you joining would contribute to the reservoir.

On a personal note, this terrifies me.  A shortfall of steam is an open-and-shut diagnosis for my leaving my last start-up. It's not difficult to get somebody to describe me as 'controversial'.  I like making something from nothing, and I'm concerned that my personality type may be an upper limit on the kind of thing I could create.  Three posible solutions are to either (1) make a substantial effort to change my personality type, (2) only work with people with whom I already have a substantial amount of goodwill and hope it lasts, or (3) work largely by myself.
