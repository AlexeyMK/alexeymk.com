### What've I been up to [since October?](/2013-10-20-the-last-10-months.md)?

Last October, I was in the process of starting [threesat](http://threesat.com), a boutique talent agency for top-tier CS college graduates.

#### A brief interlude about ThreeSat
The premise had been that top CS kids are in demand but don't yet have great judgment about (1) what it is exactly they want to do with their lives, and (2) what makes them happy and productive. As a result, they mainly go to companies that either reached out to them or that they met through a VC recruiter (or at a hackathon). If your career services experience in college was anything like mine, you know that Career Services is not a particularly useful place to talk to somebody at if you want to go into tech.

As a result of this unique series of circumstances, the only possible honest advice CS kids are getting out of college is from friends & peers who have already made it into industry (and, a little bit, glassdoor.com). On my end, I advise a few college kids a month about career choices informally, because it's a good thing to do.

ThreeSat was an attempt at "what if I could get paid to give honest, good career advice to CS kids?"  Working with [Ellen Yusti](TODOAMK: link), I started more pro-actively reaching out on college campuses and sitting down with students to figure out who they should be talking to. The concept was:
- have coffee (or a Skype call) with rising CS seniors who are looking for career advice
- find 5 great companies for each person we talk to (unless you can see from the conversation they're actually a pretty good fit for the places they're already considering),
- reach out to those companies if we don't have relationships with them yet, and convince them to pay us a reduced recruiter fee,
- for every company that was willing to work with us, make a direct introduction. For every company that was not, recommend the company anyway (and hope the math works out in the long run).

#### What happened to ThreeSat?
Personally, I still think it's a cool idea. The problem that Ellen and I ran into was, briefly, it is hard, time-intensive and demoralizing to reach out to companies about candidates. I'd attribute this to being generally poor at sales, but Ellen and I raised money from dozens of sponsors for the PennApps Hackathon. We weren't (particularly) bad at sales, but companies have received enough recruiter spam to refuse to give us the benefit of the doubt.

Now, a painful sales cycle is something we can power through, but it turned out that of the first 20 candidates we interviewed, there was very little overlap in the companies we'd recommend. So we'd have to do this sales cycle _a lot_.  It was not fun at all. Start-ups are hard.

Eventually, Ellen got a real job and I took a step back and thought about the problem some more.

#### Another Brief Interlude, about StandardRecruiter
Here's what I believe today: the problem with tech recruiting (IE, why engineers and companies all complain about third-party recruiting) is a barrier-to-entry problem. Companies have gotten used to the ideas of recruiters sucking and so typically won't work with anybody unless they get a strong intro and a phone call. As a result, to break into tech recruiting, you have to both narrow down the amount of companies you work with and have enough runway (or connections) to be willing to spend the first part of your company building the relationships. Both of these raise the barriers to entry and are against candidate's best interests.

The other victims of the high barrier to entry in tech recruiter are competent recruiters who are not competent salesmen (like myself). As I understand it, there are three fundamental skills required in recruiting:

1. **Sourcing** Do you have access to high-quality candidates (IE, candidates who are hire-able). Are they willing to talk to you and get your help?
2. **Curation** Can you figure out which of the companies you work with the candidate should interview with, or are you just keyword-match spamming? Often, the candidate themselves doesn't know where they should end up and your job is to help them think through the problem.
3. **Biz-Dev** Can you convince companies to work with you at a reasonable cost?

Lots of would-be matchmakers are good at 1 and 2; 3 is a pain for the reasons above, so matchmakers figure it would be easier to just do the work for free, which means they do less matchmaking than they would if they got paid for it, which means candidates and companies both suffer the pain of working with recruiters who are good at `3` but solve sourcing by spamming everybody on LinkedIn and curation by keyword-matching.  Everybody loses.

**StandardRecruiter** was an idea I worked on for a little while that attempted to solve this market imbalance. It would essentially solve (3) and offer it as a service (and for a fee) to matchmakers, who could then focus on (1) and (2). The fee would be high enough that companies I built relationships with didn't feel like the leads were spammy or low-quality, and low enough that it wouldn't make sense somebody starting the next ThreeSat would try to go around us. As trite as the comparison is, I see StandardRecruiter as Airbnb and making occasional introductions just for fun as having a friend stay on your couch.

The other cool part of StandardRecruiter, for me, was recruiting as a business-model. There are a fair number of companies who target developers and hope to eventually make money by referring them somewhere, but when it comes time to do so, they realize they must solve a whole other problem. A world in which "just use StandardRecruiter" was an option would allow companies to focus on the value they provide and not on this unrelated recruiting business.

StandardRecruiter was a lot more fun to work on than ThreeSat - companies liked the idea of filtered candidates, I started talking to a few investors, and got about two dozen companies signed up. I even got a couple of folks hired through it. Ultimately, though, I was working on my own and having a hard time focusing on the company. The timing didn't feel right; my heart wasn't in it.

TODO(AMK) piece about how weird it is to not be productive.

### Back to Contracting
After visiting my family over New Year's, I decided that it was better to work on something where I make an impact than wallow in guilt for not working on StandardRecruiter.

I spent two and a half months doing Developer Evangelism at Pebble (great company, by the way, and really fun job), and then moved on to Binti, where I am currently the first engineer building out technology to help parents reduce the paperwork and cognitive load when having an adoption (think TurboTax for Adoption). Thoroughly enjoyed the engineering challenges of building something largely by myself. It's also fun to work on problems that exist but are not typically in the valley conscience (IE, Adoption paperwork is not a big data problem, and it isn't mobile).

### Papers, please.
